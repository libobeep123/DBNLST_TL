The existing files include “LST_DBNLST_TL_Retrieval.py”, which contains the code required for LST retrieval, “all-Korea_WT.pt”, the DBNLST_TL model, and “GYH.CSV”, the normalization file used by the model. Due to GitHub's file size limitations, we were unable to upload the large input datasets, which include the processed NDVI, NDBI, BT, MNDWI, DSM, Slope, and Aspect. If you require these processed input datasets, please contact us via our corresponding author's email.
